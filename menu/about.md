I'm Alex.

20-something years old software developer from Romania father of a lovely 3 yro and probably one of the most introvert yet offensive persons you'll stumble upon.

I've been working as a software engineer for the past 6-7 years and, in one way or the other, I managed to ship code for products owned by companies such as:

* <a href="https://www.id-t.com/">ID&T</a>
* <a href="https://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>
* <a href="https://nexdep.com/">nexDep</a>
* <a href="https://ripplematch.com/">RippleMatch</a>
* <a href="https://bridgerockdata.com/">Bridgerock Data</a>
* <a href="http://digicare.no/">DigiCare</a>
* <a href="http://shoptrade.co/">ShopTrade</a>
* <a href="https://code4.ro/en/">Code4Romania</a>

I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.ascentcore.com/">AscentCore</a> a Cluj-based outsourcing company while also consulting on a daily basis for 2 other companies.

Focused only on <a href="https://www.python.org/">python</a> based technologies (with a special emphasis on <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>) alongside entire web application life cycle I have a lot of adversity when it comes to most front end technologies.

If you think there might be a mutually beneficial endeavor of which I should know more about, there's a contact page which can be used to get my attention.

Occasionally I offer my services free of charge for non profit causes with which I can relate; before reaching out to me about projects it might be worth considering whether or not they are aligned with my social and/or political views, which are considered by some to be quite conservative.
