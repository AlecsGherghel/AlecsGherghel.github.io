I'm Alex.

20-something years old software developer from Romania father of a lovely 3 yro and probably one of the most introvert yet offensive persons you might stumble upon.

I've been working as a software engineer for the past 6-7 years and, in one way or the other, I managed to ship code for products owned by companies such as:

<a href="https://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>
<a href="https://nexdep.com/">nexDep</a>
<a href="https://ripplematch.com/">RippleMatch</a>
