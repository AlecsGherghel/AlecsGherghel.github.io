I'm Alex.

20-something years old software developer from Romania father of a lovely 3 yro and probably one of the most introvert yet offensive persons you'll stumble upon.

I've been working as a software engineer for the past 6-7 years and, in one way or the other, I managed to ship code for products owned by companies such as:

* <a href="https://www.id-t.com/">ID&T</a>
* <a href="https://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>
* <a href="https://nexdep.com/">nexDep</a>
* <a href="https://ripplematch.com/">RippleMatch</a>
* <a href="https://bridgerockdata.com/">Bridgerock Data</a>
* <a href="http://digicare.no/">DigiCare</a>
* <a href="http://shoptrade.co/">ShopTrade</a>
* <a href="https://code4.ro/en/">Code4Romania</a>

I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.ascentcore.com/">AscentCore</a>, a Cluj-based outsourcing company and also consulting on a daily basis for other 2 companies. Focused only on python based technologies for the moment and entire web application life cycle I have a lot of adversity when it comes to most front end technologies.
